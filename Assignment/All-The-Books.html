                    She has power over death. He has power over her. When two enemies strike a dangerous bargain, 
                    will they end a war . . . or ignite one?
                    Heroes die, cowards live. Daughter of a conquered world, Ruying hates the invaders who descended from the heavens
                     long before she was born and defeated the magic of her people with technologies unlike anything her world had ever seen.
                     Blessed by Death, born with the ability to pull the life right out of mortal bodies, Ruying shouldn’t have to fear these foreign
                      invaders, but she does. Especially because she wants to keep herself and her family safe.When Ruying’s Gift is discovered by
                       an enemy prince, he offers her an impossible deal: If she becomes his private assassin and eliminates his political
                        rivals–whose deaths he swears would be for the good of both their worlds and would protect her people from further 
                        brutalization–her family will never starve or suffer harm again. But to accept this bargain, she must use the powers
                         she has always feared, powers that will shave years off her own existence.Can Ruying trust this prince, whose promises of a 
                         better world make her heart ache and whose smiles make her pulse beat faster? Are the evils of this agreement really in the 
                         service of a much greater good? Or will she betray her entire nation by protecting those she loves the most?</p>

                    Raised in a small village near the spirit-wood, Liska Radost knows that Magic is monstrous,
                     and its practitioners, monsters. After Liska unleashes her own powers with devastating consequences,
                      she is caught by the demon warden of the wood – the Leszy – who offers her a bargain: one year of servitude in 
                      exchange for a wish. Whisked away to his crumbling manor, Liska soon discovers the sinister roots of their bargain.
                       And if she wants to survive the year and return home, she must unravel her host’s spool of secrets and face the
                        ghosts of his past. Those who enter the wood do not always return…

                    Ryan «Quicksave» Romano is an eccentric adventurer with a strange power: he can create a save-point in time and redo 
                    his life whenever he dies. Arriving in New Rome, the glitzy capital of sin of a rebuilding Europe, he finds the 
                    city torn between mega-corporations, sponsored heroes, superpowered criminals, and true monsters. It’s a time of chaos,
                     where potions can grant the power to rule the world and dangers lurk everywhere.

                    Ryan only sees different routes; and from Hero to Villain, 
                    he has to try them all. Only then will he achieve his perfect ending… no matter how many loops it takes.

                    Everyone was shocked when Rin managed to enter Sinegard, the elite military academy in the Nikan Empire. 
                    However, surprises are not always pleasant. Because she is considered a poor villager, Rin becomes a monthly.
                     Especially because she is a woman. In a state of despair, Rin finds herself possessing a deadly supernatural 
                     power – shamanism. Under the guidance of a teacher who is considered crazy, Rin learns that the gods who have
                      been thought to be dead are still alive. The Nikan Empire lived peacefully, but its former colonizer, 
                      the Mugen Federation, continued to lurk. Rin's shamanistic power may be the only one who can save the people, 
                      but the more he gets to know the Phoenix god who chose him, the god full of wrath and vengeance, 
                      the more worried he becomes. Winning the war may have to pay dearly with humanity. And maybe it's all too late.

                    In the aftermath of the Third Poppy War, shaman and warrior Rin is on the run: haunted by the atrocity 
                    she committed to end the war, addicted to opium, and hiding from the murderous commands of her vengeful god,
                     the fiery Phoenix. Her only reason for living is to get revenge on the traitorous Empress who sold out Nikan
                      to their enemies. With no other options, Rin joins forces with the powerful Dragon Warlord, who has a plan to
                       conquer Nikan, unseat the Empress, and create a new Republic. Rin throws herself into his war. After all, making 
                       war is all she knows how to do. But the Empress is a more powerful foe than she appears, and the Dragon
                        Warlord’s motivations are not as democratic as they seem. The more Rin learns, the more she fears her 
                        love for Nikan will drive her away from every ally and lead her to rely more and more on the Phoenix’s deadly 
                        power. Because there is nothing she won’t sacrifice for her country and her vengeance.
                         The sequel to R.F. Kuang’s acclaimed debut THE POPPY WAR, THE DRAGON REPUBLIC combines
                          the history of 20th-century China with a gripping world of gods and monsters, to devastating effect.

                    In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
                     of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: 
                     it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant
                      critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the 
                      hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the
                       adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent.
